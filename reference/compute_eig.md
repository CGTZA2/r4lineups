# Compute Expected Information Gain (EIG)

Computes Expected Information Gain for lineup identification procedures
following Starns et al. (2023). EIG quantifies the evidentiary value of
witness responses using information theory.

## Usage

``` r
compute_eig(
  eig_data,
  prior_guilt = 0.5,
  confidence_bins = NULL,
  lineup_size = 6,
  innocent_suspect = "auto"
)
```

## Arguments

- eig_data:

  List output from make_eig_data(), or a dataframe with columns:
  target_present, identification, confidence

- prior_guilt:

  Numeric. Prior probability that suspect is guilty (default = 0.5)

- confidence_bins:

  Numeric vector of bin edges (only used if eig_data is a dataframe)

- lineup_size:

  Nominal lineup size used when raw target-absent data have no
  designated innocent suspect.

- innocent_suspect:

  How innocent-suspect identifications in target-absent lineups are
  obtained. `"designated"`: the lineups had a designated innocent
  suspect, so target-absent `"suspect"` rows are counted directly, and
  zero such rows means a false-ID rate of zero. `"estimated"`: there was
  no designated innocent suspect, so the innocent-suspect count is
  estimated as filler IDs divided by `lineup_size`. `"auto"` (the
  default) chooses `"designated"` when any target-absent row is a
  suspect ID or the data have a non-missing `suspect_pos` column, and
  `"estimated"` otherwise, with a message.

## Value

A list of class "lineup_eig" containing:

- eig: Expected Information Gain in bits

- response_data: Dataframe with information gain for each response
  category

- prior_guilt: Prior probability used

- prior_entropy: Entropy of prior (baseline uncertainty)

- n_guilty: Number of target-present lineups

- n_innocent: Number of target-absent lineups

## Details

EIG measures how much information (in bits) a witness response provides
about guilt vs. innocence. It is computed as:

\$\$EIG = \sum_x p(x) \times \[H(prior) - H(p(guilty\|x))\]\$\$

where:

- x = response category (e.g., "suspect_high_confidence")

- p(x) = probability of that response

- H() = Shannon entropy

- p(guilty\|x) = posterior probability of guilt given response x

Higher EIG values indicate more diagnostic procedures. EIG = 0 means no
information gain (responses don't distinguish guilty from innocent). The
maximum EIG is the prior entropy; it is 1 bit only at prior guilt 0.5.
