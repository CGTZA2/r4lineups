# Changelog

## r4lineups 2.3.0 (development)

### Breaking changes

- [`make_dpp()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_dpp.md)
  now computes the deviation from perfect performance as Smith,
  Lampinen, Wells, Smalarz and Mackovichova (2019) define it: DPP(c) =
  1 - Culprit(c) + Innocent(c) at each ROC operating point, averaged
  over the operating points (their Equation 2). The previous statistic,
  1 - AUC(observed) / AUC(perfect) over the observed false-ID range, was
  a different quantity under the same name, and it cited an unrelated
  paper. On a single operating point with culprit rate .8 and
  innocent-suspect rate .1, the old function returned .6; the published
  measure is .3. The new version reproduces Smith et al.’s Table 4 (.864
  and .816). The return value now has `dpp`, `dpp_by_point` and
  `best_point` in place of `auc_observed`, `auc_perfect`, `auc_gap`,
  `perfect_roc` and `max_fa`. Optional `alpha` and `beta` arguments give
  their weighted Equation 3.
- [`compare_dpp()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_dpp.md)
  now bootstraps the difference in average DPP (stratified by target
  presence within each procedure) and returns its standard error and a
  percentile interval, with a print method.
  [`plot_dpp()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_dpp.md)
  plots DPP at each operating point;
  [`plot_dpp_comparison()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_dpp_comparison.md)
  overlays two procedures and loses its `layout` argument.
  [`plot_dpp()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_dpp.md)
  arguments are now `show_mean`, `show_chance` and `show_dpp`.

### New features

- Every analysis that uses target-absent lineups gains an
  `innocent_suspect` argument: `"designated"`, `"estimated"` (filler IDs
  / lineup size), or `"auto"` (the default). The app’s Data tab has a
  matching control. See the bug fix below.
- [`make_cacdata()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_cacdata.md),
  [`make_cac()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_cac.md),
  [`ppv_by_confidence()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/ppv_by_confidence.md),
  [`ppv_range_by_confidence()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/ppv_range_by_confidence.md)
  and
  [`make_ppv_range()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_ppv_range.md)
  gain `base_rate`. Count-based accuracy, the Mickes (2015) definition,
  stays the default, but it equals the probability of guilt only when
  the target-present and target-absent samples are the same size: with
  HR = .6 and FAR = .1 it gives .857, .923 or .667 for TP:TA splits of
  100:100, 200:100 and 100:300. These functions now say so in a message
  when the arms differ. `base_rate = 0.5` computes accuracy from the hit
  and false-ID rates instead, which gives .857 for all three; other
  values apply Bayes’ rule at that prior. The rate-based CAC standard
  error is a delta-method approximation. Existing results are unchanged.

### Bug fixes

- [`make_rocdata()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_rocdata.md)
  and
  [`make_utility_curves()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_utility_curves.md)
  took a confidence criterion from every response, rejections included.
  The extra criteria only duplicated existing operating points, so the
  ROC path and partial AUC were unaffected, but averages over points
  were reweighted by how rejection confidence happened to be coded.
  Changing only the rejection confidences (from 0 to values between 51
  and 99) moved average DPP from .417 to .647 and equal-variance z-ROC
  d’ from 1.879 to 1.398. The criteria are now the confidence levels of
  the responses that can move an operating point: target-present suspect
  IDs, plus target-absent suspect IDs with a designated suspect or
  filler IDs without one. Both codings now give DPP .475 and d’ 1.757.
  Results change for data in which rejections or filler IDs carry
  confidence levels that no counted ID uses; `lineup_example` is
  unaffected.
  [`make_rocdata()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_rocdata.md),
  [`make_dpp()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_dpp.md)
  and
  [`make_utility_curves()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_utility_curves.md)
  gain `thresholds` to set the criteria, and
  [`make_rocdata()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_rocdata.md)
  and
  [`make_dpp()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_dpp.md)
  return the criteria used.
  [`compare_dpp()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_dpp.md)
  and the
  [`fit_sdt_roc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/fit_sdt_roc.md)
  bootstrap reuse the full-sample criteria in every replicate, so that
  all replicates estimate the same average.

- Target presence coded 0/1, which the validator accepts, broke the
  bootstraps in
  [`compare_pauc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_pauc.md)
  (an error) and
  [`fit_sdt_roc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/fit_sdt_roc.md),
  where every replicate failed silently and the intervals were `NA` with
  `n_successful = 0`. Both now resample 0/1 and logical coding
  identically.
  [`fit_sdt_roc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/fit_sdt_roc.md)
  also warns when bootstrap samples fail, giving the number and the
  first error.

- [`func_size_report()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/func_size_report.md)
  bootstrapped functional size, 1/p, and `boot.ci()` silently dropped
  the resamples with no target choices, where it is infinite. With one
  target choice among 30 mock witnesses, 353 of 1,000 resamples were
  dropped and the percentile interval was \[10, 30\]. The bootstrap now
  resamples p and inverts its limits, which gives the same percentile
  and BCa intervals when every resample is finite and an unbounded upper
  limit when it is not (\[10, Inf\] here). The result gains an exact
  interval (inverted Clopper-Pearson, \[5.81, 1185.44\] here) and
  `n_infinite`, the number of resamples without target choices. The
  app’s Bias & size tab shows both, and displays infinite limits instead
  of leaving them blank.

- [`standardize_lineup_data()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/standardize_lineup_data.md)
  kept only the columns it maps, so it dropped `suspect_pos` and
  `lineup_member`. A designated suspect who was never chosen then fell
  back to the filler estimate after standardization (false-ID rate .10
  instead of 0), and effective-size-corrected PPV lost its member
  choices (.833 instead of .50 when target-absent choices fall on one
  member). Every column it does not map is now carried through
  unchanged.

- [`compare_multid()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_multid.md)
  differenced the two bootstrap matrices row by row. The conditions are
  independent samples, but fits made with the same seed have correlated
  draws, so the standard error collapsed. Comparing counts (60, 25, 15,
  10, 30, 60) with (60, 27, 13, 10, 30, 60), both fitted with seed 1,
  gave d’(GFp) a standard error of .014 and p \< .0001; the correct
  values are .347 and .86. Identical inputs gave a zero-width interval.
  The standard error is now the square root of the sum of the two
  bootstrap variances, and the interval comes from randomly re-paired
  draws.
  [`compare_multid()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_multid.md)
  gains `seed`.

- [`get_face_landmarks()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/get_face_landmarks.md)
  failed with every current MediaPipe release. The image was read into R
  and passed back as an int32 array, which OpenCV and MediaPipe reject,
  and the function used `mediapipe.solutions.face_mesh`, which current
  MediaPipe no longer has. The image now stays a uint8 numpy array, and
  when `solutions` is absent the MediaPipe Tasks `FaceLandmarker` is
  used. Its model is downloaded once to
  `tools::R_user_dir("r4lineups", "cache")`. Both routes return the
  478-point mesh (468 face points plus 10 iris points); the
  documentation said 468.
  [`check_python_deps()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/check_python_deps.md)
  now records in a `"face_mesh"` attribute whether landmarks can
  actually be extracted, not only whether MediaPipe imports. An opt-in
  test (`R4LINEUPS_RUN_FACE=true`) exercises the whole path.

- In the app’s Bias & size tab, ticking “Small-sample corrected E’”
  changed the reported estimate but left its intervals on the plug-in
  estimator, so the value box could show a corrected E’ with a plug-in
  interval that did not contain it.
  [`esize_boot_dist()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_boot_dist.md)
  gains `unbiased = FALSE`, which bootstraps the corrected estimator
  (dropping, with a warning, resamples where it is unbounded). The app
  now bootstraps the corrected E’ when it reports it, and lists the
  plug-in estimate with its own normal-theory and bootstrap intervals on
  separately labelled rows.

- Target-absent data with a designated innocent suspect who was never
  chosen were treated as having no designated suspect, so the false-ID
  rate was estimated from filler IDs instead of being zero. With 100
  target-absent lineups, 60 filler IDs and no suspect IDs, the ROC
  reached a false-ID rate of .10 instead of 0. `"auto"` now treats the
  lineups as designated when any target-absent row is a suspect ID *or*
  the data carry a non-missing `suspect_pos` column (as
  [`simulate_lineup_data()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/simulate_lineup_data.md)
  output and `lineup_example` do). Otherwise it falls back to the filler
  estimate with a message. Bootstraps
  ([`compare_pauc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_pauc.md),
  [`fit_sdt_roc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/fit_sdt_roc.md),
  [`bootstrap_anri()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/bootstrap_anri.md),
  [`compare_anri()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_anri.md)),
  [`make_calibration_by_condition()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_calibration_by_condition.md),
  [`make_utility_difference()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_utility_difference.md),
  [`ppv_range_by_confidence()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/ppv_range_by_confidence.md)
  and the
  [`make_multid()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_multid.md)
  confidence breakdown now resolve the design once on the full data, so
  a resample that happens to contain no suspect IDs no longer switches
  estimator.

- [`ppv_by_confidence()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/ppv_by_confidence.md)
  dropped every confidence bin that contained no target-absent trials,
  and with it that bin’s guilty-suspect IDs, so both the bin and the
  overall PPV were wrong. With 90 guilty IDs at confidence 100 and all
  target-absent responses at 50, the overall PPV was .50 instead of
  .909. Such bins are now kept, with no innocent-suspect IDs (PPV 1) and
  an `NA` error rate and effective size. Only bins empty in both arms
  are dropped.
  [`make_ppv_range()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_ppv_range.md)
  and its plots inherit the fix.

- `boot_winter_2ht(method = "bca")` failed with a `dimnames` error,
  because the interval matrix was transposed into the wrong shape, and
  even before that its acceleration was fixed at 0, so the “BCa”
  interval was only bias-corrected. The acceleration is now the
  jackknife estimate (one refit per non-empty response cell, weighted by
  its count), the bias correction handles ties and stays finite, and
  both methods return a parameters x (Lower, Upper) matrix.

- The posterior means reported by
  [`func_size_bayes()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/func_size_bayes.md),
  [`diag_ratio_T_bayes()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/diag_ratio_T_bayes.md)
  and
  [`diag_ratio_T_bayes_compare()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/diag_ratio_T_bayes_compare.md)
  were averages of reciprocal draws. When the relevant Beta posterior
  has shape a \<= 1 (for example, no suspect choices under the Jeffreys
  prior), the true mean is infinite and the average never settled: it
  was about 11 million, 3 million and 36 million for 10^3, 10^4 and 10^5
  draws of the same functional size. The means are now computed exactly,
  `(a + b - 1) / (a - 1)` for `1/p`, and are `Inf` when they do not
  exist. Print methods say so; a difference of two infinite means is
  `NA`. Medians, intervals and threshold probabilities are unchanged.

- [`compare_pauc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_pauc.md)
  overstated partial AUC whenever the ROC had a vertical segment, that
  is, when a confidence level added correct IDs but no false IDs. Its
  integrator kept only the upper endpoint of each such segment, so the
  next sloping segment started from too high a correct-ID rate. A curve
  through (0, 0), (0, .5), (.1, .5) and (.1, 1) has area .05;
  [`compare_pauc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_pauc.md)
  reported .075 while
  [`make_rocdata()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_rocdata.md)
  reported .05. Both now use one internal integrator that keeps every
  endpoint and interpolates within the segment that crosses the cutoff,
  and their results agree. The
  [`compare_pauc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_pauc.md)
  bootstrap and
  [`simulate_power_analysis()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/simulate_power_analysis.md)
  use the same integrator.

## r4lineups 2.2.0 (2026-10-28)

### Breaking changes

- The first argument of
  [`esize_T()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T.md),
  [`esize_m()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_m.md),
  [`i_esize_T()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/i_esize_T.md),
  [`gen_linevec()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/gen_linevec.md),
  [`lineup_prop_tab()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/lineup_prop_tab.md),
  [`allfoilbias()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/allfoilbias.md),
  [`datacheck3()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/datacheck3.md),
  [`esize_T_boot()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T_boot.md),
  [`esize_T_bayes()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T_bayes.md)
  and
  [`esize_T_ci_n()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T_ci_n.md)
  is renamed from `lineup_table` to `lineup_tab`, so that it no longer
  collides with the new
  [`lineup_table()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/lineup_table.md)
  function (see below). Code that calls these functions positionally is
  unaffected; code that passes the argument by name (e.g.
  `esize_T(lineup_table = x)`) must be updated to
  `esize_T(lineup_tab = x)`.

- [`simulate_power_analysis()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/simulate_power_analysis.md)
  now performs an actual power analysis and its arguments have changed
  accordingly. It takes `d_prime_null` (the comparison condition),
  `n_bootstrap`, `lineup_size`, `seed` and `verbose`; the former
  `stat_function` argument is replaced by `test_function`, which takes
  two dataframes and returns a p-value. The returned columns are now
  `sample_size`, `power`, `power_se`, `mean_effect`, `sd_effect` and
  `n_valid`. See the bug-fix entry below for why this was necessary.

- `lineup_example` has been regenerated and now has 1400 rows rather
  than 200, with `lineup_member` and `suspect_pos` columns. Numeric
  results computed from it will differ from previous versions.

### Bug fixes

- [`simulate_power_analysis()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/simulate_power_analysis.md)
  computed power as the proportion of simulations in which the pAUC
  exceeded zero. A partial area under a curve is always positive, so
  that proportion was **always exactly 1**, for every sample size and
  every effect size, and the resulting power curve was a flat line at
  the top of the plot. Power is now the proportion of simulated studies
  in which a test of the difference between two conditions reaches
  significance, using
  [`compare_pauc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_pauc.md)
  by default. The single test covering this function was skipped and
  additionally asserted a field the function never returned, so the
  fault could not have been caught; it has been replaced with tests that
  run.

- [`make_roc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_roc.md),
  [`make_cac()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_cac.md),
  [`make_rac()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_rac.md),
  [`make_fullroc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_fullroc.md),
  [`make_calibration()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_calibration.md)
  and
  [`compute_dpp()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compute_dpp.md)
  set `$plot` to `NULL` when called with `show_plot = FALSE`, so
  suppressing display also destroyed the plot object. `result$plot` was
  then `NULL` and nothing could be drawn from it — the cause of several
  “the plot does not show” reports. The plot is now always built, and
  `show_plot` controls only whether it is displayed immediately, which
  is what its documentation always said it did.

- [`compare_pauc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_pauc.md)
  chose its default region of integration as the **larger** of the two
  conditions’ maximum false-ID rates. Since neither curve extends past
  its own maximum and no extrapolation is performed, the curve that
  stopped sooner was integrated over a smaller interval than the other,
  so the two “partial areas” covered different regions and were not
  comparable. In testing, this understated a real difference by around
  14%. The default is now the largest region **both** curves attain, a
  message reports it when the two differ, and an explicit
  `max_false_id_rate` beyond either curve’s reach now warns.

- [`make_fullroc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_fullroc.md)
  and
  [`make_fullroc_data()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_fullroc_data.md)
  now report that the default `order = "diagnosticity"` is
  optimistically biased. Because the ordering of evidence categories is
  estimated from the same data used to compute the area, data containing
  no signal at all return a mean AUC of roughly 0.65 at 100 lineups per
  arm, 0.60 at 200 and 0.55 at 1000, against a true value of 0.5.
  A-priori ordering is unbiased at every sample size tested. The default
  is unchanged, since it is the ordering Smith et al. describe, but a
  message now points to `order = "apriori"` for inferential use.

- [`fit_winter_2ht()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/fit_winter_2ht.md)
  failed with `non-finite finite-difference value` when the data
  contained almost no lineup rejections. The detect-absence parameter
  `dA` is identified by rejections, so the likelihood is nearly flat
  without them. It now stops with a message naming the actual problem
  and the likely cause — a decision criterion so liberal that witnesses
  never reject.
  [`compare_models()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_models.md)
  had silently omitted the 2-HT model in this situation, so every
  downstream section that referred to it produced no output.

- `format_comparison_table(format = "markdown")` produced a table that
  rendered as a single run-on paragraph. It returns a `knitr_kable`
  object, which is a character vector with one element per line, and the
  vignette printed it with `cat(x)` — joining the lines with spaces. The
  vignette now uses `cat(x, sep = "\n")` and the return value is
  documented as line-per-element. The markdown and latex forms also
  called `kable()` without `row.names = FALSE`, so row names inherited
  from the named parameter vectors (“dP”, “dA”, …) appeared as a
  spurious unlabelled first column.

- [`plot_2ht_parameters()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_2ht_parameters.md)
  rejected `winter_2ht_boot` objects, although its documentation offered
  confidence intervals “if bootstrapped”. It now accepts them and draws
  the bootstrap percentile intervals. For a plain fit it still draws
  normal approximations, but clamped to \[0, 1\]: all four parameters
  are probabilities, and on `lineup_example` the interval for `b`
  previously ran to -0.023.

- [`plot.esize_T_bayes()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot.esize_T_bayes.md)
  packed the credible interval into the plot title using an embedded
  newline, producing a two-line 74-character title laid out as a single
  text grob — the usual cause of a heading running off the top of a
  rendered figure. The interval is now a subtitle. The other five
  Bayesian plot methods were checked and none had the same fault.

- Effective size is no longer referred to eponymously as “Tredoux
  effective size” in documentation, printed output or plot labels; it is
  now “effective size” with the citation (Tredoux, 1998). Affects
  [`esize_T()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T.md),
  [`i_esize_T()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/i_esize_T.md),
  [`esize_T_ci_n()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T_ci_n.md)
  and the
  [`esize_T_bayes()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T_bayes.md)
  family.

- [`fit_max_sdt()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/fit_max_sdt.md)
  left bootstrap replicates that failed to converge as `NA` rows in
  `boot_params` without recording how many, so
  `sd(fit$boot_params[, 1])` returned `NA` unexplained. It now reports
  `boot_n_used` and `boot_n_failed`, warns when more than 10% fail, and
  errors rather than returning meaningless intervals if all of them do.
  Its documentation also gained a “Provenance” section crediting the R
  scripts of A. M. Smith from which the implementation follows, and a
  “Relation to Smith’s scripts” section explaining why estimates differ:
  this function uses five mutually exclusive response cells, whereas
  those scripts fit total target-present choices alongside culprit
  identifications, counting the latter twice.

- [`install_r4lineups_python()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/install_r4lineups_python.md)
  failed with reticulate’s opaque
  `Suitable Python installation for creating a venv not found` when
  `python_version` named a version not present on the machine, without
  saying how to obtain one. It now checks first, reports which versions
  it did find, and gives the
  [`reticulate::install_python()`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/install_python.html)
  call needed.

- `Vignette.Rmd` drew random numbers – simulated ages and every
  bootstrap – without a seed, so its output changed on every build.
  Seeded once in setup.

- [`make_bayes_curves()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_bayes_curves.md)
  now warns when a response category has no observations in one arm. The
  likelihood ratio is then unbounded and the prior-posterior curve is
  pinned flat at 0 or 1, which looks like a plotting fault rather than a
  data problem.

- The member-level branch of the effective-size calculation in
  [`ppv_by_confidence()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/ppv_by_confidence.md)
  counted rejections as a lineup position and did not tabulate over all
  positions, so unchosen members were dropped. This branch was
  previously unreachable, as no dataset supplied a `lineup_member`
  column.

- [`plot_lineup_bias_distribution()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_lineup_bias_distribution.md)
  and
  [`plot_esize_distribution()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_esize_distribution.md)
  no longer draw ragged histograms with structural gaps. A bootstrapped
  lineup proportion is a count over a fixed denominator, so the
  replicates fall on a lattice with spacing `1/n`; binning them at a
  fixed 30 bins left bins that contained no attainable value empty
  regardless of the data, and made bins that straddled two attainable
  values twice as tall as their neighbours. The bin width is now chosen
  to match the lattice, giving one bar per attainable value. Estimates
  that are effectively continuous still use 30 bins. Both functions
  gained `bins` and `binwidth` arguments for explicit control.

- [`plot_fullroc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_fullroc.md)
  labelled the plot `"Ordering method: "` with nothing after it when
  given the output of
  [`make_fullroc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_fullroc.md),
  because the ordering method is recorded at `$order_used` on a
  [`make_fullroc_data()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_fullroc_data.md)
  object but at `$summary$order_method` on a
  [`make_fullroc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_fullroc.md)
  object. Both shapes are now accepted, and an object carrying neither
  raises an informative error.

- [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) now works on
  the ROC and CAC objects.
  [`make_rocdata()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_rocdata.md),
  [`make_cacdata()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_cacdata.md)
  and
  [`make_fullroc_data()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_fullroc_data.md)
  returned unclassed lists, so `plot(x)` dispatched to
  [`plot.default()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) and
  failed; the package registered `print` methods for these objects but
  no `plot` methods. Added
  [`plot.lineup_roc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_roc_cac.md),
  [`plot.lineup_cac()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_roc_cac.md),
  [`plot.lineup_fullroc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_roc_cac.md)
  and methods for the corresponding `*_data` classes, all reusing the
  existing
  [`make_roc_gg()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_roc_gg.md),
  [`make_cac_gg()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_cac_gg.md)
  and
  [`plot_fullroc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot_fullroc.md)
  builders.

- [`install_r4lineups_python()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/install_r4lineups_python.md)
  pinned no Python version, so reticulate could select an interpreter
  newer than any for which TensorFlow publishes wheels, and the install
  failed partway through with
  `No matching distribution found for tensorflow`. It now checks the
  interpreter before downloading anything and stops with an actionable
  message, and gained a `python_version` argument for building the
  virtual environment from a supported interpreter.

### New features

- New
  [`make_multid()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_multid.md)
  implements Lee and Penrod’s (2019) Multi-d’ model. From target-present
  and target-absent lineup data (trial-level or counts) it computes
  d’(GI), d’(GFp), d’(IFa), d’(FaFp) and d’(RaRp), the TP and TA
  lineup-bias indices, the criterion and the diagnosticity ratio, with
  optional bootstrap intervals and a cumulative breakdown by confidence.
  Because the model uses total filler rates, a fair lineup does not give
  d’(IFa) = 0, so the result also reports the d’(IFa) a perfectly fair
  lineup would give at the observed rejection rate.
  [`compare_multid()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/compare_multid.md)
  compares two conditions, and
  [`plot.multid()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot.multid.md)
  draws the decomposition of d’(GI), the indices, or the indices by
  confidence. The tests reproduce Lee and Penrod’s Tables 3, 4 and

  9.  See
      [`vignette("multid_model")`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/articles/multid_model.md).

- [`esize_T()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T.md)
  gained an `unbiased` argument. The default (`FALSE`) is the plug-in
  estimator as before, so no existing result changes. `unbiased = TRUE`
  applies the small-sample correction `N(N-1) / sum(o(o-1))`. The
  plug-in form is biased **downward**, by approximately
  `k(k-1)/(N + k - 1)`: a perfectly fair six-person lineup assessed with
  50 choices returns about 5.47 rather than 6, and with 20 choices about
  4.87. The correction removes essentially all of it in simulation, at a
  variance cost that disappears by about 100 choices. The bias, the
  evidence and the choice between the two forms are documented in
  [`?esize_T`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T.md),
  with cross-references from
  [`?esize_m`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_m.md)
  and
  [`?esize_T_ci_n`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T_ci_n.md).

- New
  [`classify_lineup_choices()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/classify_lineup_choices.md)
  derives identification outcomes (suspect ID, foil ID, rejection) from
  the raw record of which lineup member each witness chose. Lineup data
  should record the member chosen, with the collapsed label derived from
  it rather than stored in its place, because foils are not
  interchangeable and a foil nobody ever chooses is what makes a lineup
  unfair.

- [`simulate_lineup_data()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/simulate_lineup_data.md)
  gained a `foil_bias` argument, giving each foil its own mean memory
  strength so that foils differ in plausibility rather than being drawn
  from a common distribution. The default (`NULL`) preserves the
  previous behaviour exactly.

- [`simulate_lineup_data()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/simulate_lineup_data.md)
  now returns `lineup_member` (the position chosen, 0 for a rejection)
  and `suspect_pos` alongside `identification`. The chosen position was
  already computed internally and discarded.

- [`plot.power_analysis()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/plot.power_analysis.md)
  shows a Monte Carlo interval around the power curve, so that apparent
  dips between adjacent points can be recognised as simulation noise,
  and returns the ggplot object invisibly for further modification.

- [`homog_diag()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/homog_diag.md)
  and
  [`homog_diag_boot()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/homog_diag_boot.md)
  now report the diagnosticity ratio and a confidence interval for each
  lineup pair, not just the pooled mean and the chi-square. The
  chi-square is Cochran’s Q, which measures how far the k ratios lie
  from their pooled value; that is a different question from whether the
  pooled ratio differs from 1, and the two can disagree sharply. Ratios
  of 6.0, 1.0 and 0.44 give Q = 45.6 (p \< .0001) while pooling to 1.06,
  because they cancel on the log scale — an output that reads as “highly
  significant, but no diagnosticity” unless the per-pair values are
  visible. Both functions now print a note stating whether the ratios
  are heterogeneous and, when they are, that the pooled estimate
  averages quantities that are not estimating a common parameter and
  should not be reported on its own. The returned list gained a
  `heterogeneous` flag, and
  [`homog_diag_boot()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/homog_diag_boot.md)
  gained `df` and `p_value`; the `parameters` element now carries `d`,
  `ln_d`, `var_lnd`, `wi`, `lower` and `upper` alongside the existing
  cell counts. Both functions gained a `conf.level` argument, which also
  sets the level for
  [`homog_diag_boot()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/homog_diag_boot.md)’s
  percentile intervals (default 0.95, unchanged from the previous
  hard-coded value).

- Added
  [`lineup_table()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/lineup_table.md),
  which tabulates lineup choices across all `k` positions so that null
  foils — members no mock witness chose — appear as explicit zeroes
  rather than being silently dropped by
  [`table()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/table.html). Its print method names
  the null foils and marks the nominated suspect. The result inherits
  from `table`, so it can be passed to
  [`esize_m()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_m.md),
  [`esize_T()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/esize_T.md)
  and the other table-taking functions unchanged.

### Shiny app

- The app bundled with
  [`run_r4lineups_app()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/run_r4lineups_app.md)
  has been rebuilt on `bslib`, with one module per analysis. Every
  number it shows now comes from an exported r4lineups function; the
  app’s own copy of the Malpass effective-size formula is gone.
- The ROC, CAC, full ROC, pAUC, EIG and PPV analyses previously assumed
  a six-person lineup whatever the data. Lineup size is now set on a new
  Data tab, which loads one confidence-based data set (built-in or
  uploaded) for all of these analyses and lets any column define two
  groups to compare.
- New tabs cover the diagnosticity ratio and its homogeneity test, Lee
  and Penrod’s Multi-d’ model, and calibration and decision analyses
  (ANRI, DPP, expected utility, Bayesian and BREE curves, RAC). The
  fairness tab adds the binomial test against chance, bootstrap
  distributions, functional size and the corrected E’.
- Bootstrap and posterior analyses now run when *Run analysis* is
  clicked rather than on every keystroke, take a seed, and are computed
  once, so a table’s interval and the plotted distribution come from the
  same draws. Messages and warnings from the package are shown beside
  the results.
- Every table downloads as CSV and every plot as PNG. “Download ROC/CAC
  data” previously wrote an `.rds` file.
- The app no longer counts sessions on disk or fetches download totals
  from CRAN and GitHub at start-up.
- The face similarity tab now includes the Python setup that used to be
  the first tab, and is hidden when `reticulate` is unavailable.
- [`run_r4lineups_app()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/run_r4lineups_app.md)
  checks that `shiny`, `bslib` and `DT` are installed. `bslib` and
  `shinytest2` join Suggests; `shinyWidgets` and `jsonlite` leave.

### Output and documentation

- [`make_racdata()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_racdata.md)
  labels response-time bins in plain notation, e.g. `[2390,4810]` rather
  than `[2.39e+03,4.81e+03]`.

- ROC and CAC print methods now say
  `"Plot: use plot(x), or save the object and extract x$plot"` rather
  than the cryptic `"Plot available in $plot"`.

- [`print.lineup_roc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/print.lineup_roc.md)
  and
  [`print.lineup_fullroc()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/print.lineup_fullroc.md)
  now report `"Target-present trials (N)"` rather than
  `"Target-present lineups"`, which read as a count of lineups when it
  is a count of witnesses.

- [`make_roc_gg()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_roc_gg.md)
  now names the ROC variant in the title, so a partial ROC is not
  mistaken for a full ROC, and records the data source in the caption.
  It gained `title` and `data_source` arguments.

- [`eff_size_per_foils()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/eff_size_per_foils.md)
  had no `@return` documentation at all. Documented that it returns a
  count of lineup members, so it changes only in whole steps as `conf`
  varies and is flat across ranges of `conf` in which no member’s
  interval crosses `1/k`.

- [`eff_size_per_foils()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/eff_size_per_foils.md)
  and
  [`lineup_boot_allprop()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/lineup_boot_allprop.md)
  both described `conf` as “Desired level of alpha”; it is a confidence
  level. Documented also that
  [`lineup_boot_allprop()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/lineup_boot_allprop.md)
  applies no multiplicity correction across the `k` intervals it
  returns.

- The main vignette has been substantially revised: corrected a typo
  (`line_df$linep_vec`), a reference to a nonexistent `sample_data`
  dataset, an inverted functional size formula (`D/N` for `N/D`), a
  misstated proportion (“0.14%” for 14%), a misattributed sentence (“He
  instead proposed” for “Tredoux instead proposed”), and inline code
  spans that reflowed into a paragraph instead of forming a code chunk.
  Added sections on null foils, normal-theory versus bootstrap
  intervals, multiplicity across lineup members, functional size
  exceeding nominal size, the `boot.ci()` warnings, the
  `*_data()`/wrapper distinction in the ROC and CAC functions, and raw
  data format for ROC analysis. The homogeneity section now separates
  the two questions the output answers — whether the k ratios agree with
  one another (chi-square) and whether the average ratio differs from 1
  (interval on the pooled ratio) — with a worked heterogeneous example
  in which every ratio is diagnostic, followed by a cautionary example
  in which ratios pointing in opposite directions give a very large
  chi-square while pooling to roughly 1. The unsupported version 1
  `face_sim()` section has been retired in favour of a pointer to the
  face similarity vignette, and the vignette closes with a linked index
  of the other vignettes.

## r4lineups 2.1.0 (2026-08-10)

- Added an explicit authorship and acknowledgements statement
  recognizing Colin Tredoux and Tamsyn Naylor as authors of the original
  package; the use of Codex and Claude for code-review, drafting, and
  debugging support in the latest development cycle; and the published
  work on which the package’s computational methods rely. Suspected
  implementation errors should be reported through the GitHub issue
  tracker.
- Relicensed the package under the permissive MIT license and added
  canonical citation metadata for the CRAN and JOSS release.

### Wixted lineup-memory model interface

- Added
  [`install_pywitness()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/install_pywitness.md)
  and
  [`check_pywitness_deps()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/check_pywitness_deps.md)
  for an explicit, isolated `r4lineups-pywitness` virtual environment.
  Installation uses the immutable archive for audited pyWitness revision
  `e726dcfc09423d0e0ff7f46c8e3a711040293eba`; package loading and
  ordinary CRAN checks never install or initialize it.
- Added
  [`fit_lineup_models()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/fit_lineup_models.md)
  for fair simultaneous lineups, with Independent Observations,
  Ensemble, Integration, and optional BEST-Rest fits; equal- and
  unequal-variance paths; zero or estimated shared variance where
  identified; starting values; optimizer controls; and explicit
  convergence diagnostics.
- Results are durable R-native `lineup_model_comparison` objects with
  extracted parameters, observed and expected response cells, Pearson
  statistics, degrees of freedom, p-values, confidence binning, engine
  metadata, and comparison/fit/ROC plots. No live Python object is
  retained.
- The audited engine minimizes Pearson chi-squared. The reported
  multinomial log likelihood is evaluated at that estimate rather than
  maximized, so AIC and BIC are deliberately `NA` rather than invalidly
  treating it as an MLE.
- BEST-Rest and Ensemble are reported as scale-equivalent
  parameterizations and are never counted as independent model-selection
  evidence. Integration is a historical comparator rather than a
  recommended default.
- Added opt-in, three-platform Python tests for wrapper/direct-engine
  parity, parameter and generating-model recovery, probability
  partitions, BEST-Rest/Ensemble rescaling, equal/unequal variance,
  zero/estimated shared variance, sparse confidence cells, and optimizer
  failure.

## r4lineups 2.0.0 (2026-08-08)

Major release: a substantial expansion of the package from the 0.1.x
fairness-measure toolkit into a full analysis suite for eyewitness
identification research, plus a package-wide statistical audit.

### CRAN-readiness and statistical corrections

- Corrected the legacy fairness estimators and bootstrap helpers:
  unchosen lineup positions are retained, named count tables are matched
  by member label, Malpass and Tredoux effective sizes use the
  documented definitions, Tredoux bootstrap resampling occurs at the
  witness level, and bootstrap standard errors are the standard
  deviation of the replicate statistics.
- Corrected diagnosticity pairing, log-ratio variance, inverse-variance
  weighting, homogeneity degrees of freedom, and independent TP/TA
  resampling. `pos_list` now denotes the actual suspect position for
  each TP/TA pair (or a two-element TP/TA position pair). Homogeneity
  inference requires positive suspect-ID cells, as in Tredoux’s
  uncorrected log-risk procedure.
- Confidence-based methods now distinguish observed designated
  innocent-suspect IDs from estimates based on target-absent filler IDs.
  ROC/CAC/RAC, calibration, PPV, utility, full ROC, EIG, and Bayesian
  curves no longer add both quantities. With no designated suspect, full
  ROC/EIG/Bayesian response probabilities split target-absent filler
  choices into `1 / lineup_size` suspect and
  `(lineup_size - 1) / lineup_size` filler components.
- Full-ROC documentation now identifies empirical diagnosticity ordering
  as an optimistic, sample-dependent ordering. PPV/effective-size,
  utility false-alarm, fractional calibration/ANRI, saturated
  single-condition 2-HT, and method-of-moments mSDT assumptions are
  stated explicitly.
- Corrected pAUC sorting/interpolation and stratified its bootstrap;
  corrected unequal-variance z-ROC discriminability and raw-data
  resampling; fixed binary SDT-GLM validation and the covariance term in
  summary-level log-beta comparisons.
- Seed-taking simulation and bootstrap functions now restore the
  caller’s RNG state. Bootstrap count and confidence arguments are
  validated and honored, optimizer/bootstrap failures are checked, and
  numerical/vector edge cases receive explicit errors.
- Optional Python dependency checks no longer initialize or download a
  managed Python installation. Face-embedding distances reject missing,
  non-finite, unequal-length, or zero-norm vectors as appropriate.
- Added package-wide export-contract and hand-calculation regression
  tests. All 156 exported functions are referenced by the test suite;
  functions that require Python, Shiny, `lme4`, images, or other
  optional environments have explicit dependency/error-path coverage and
  opt-in smoke-test exemptions.
- Reduced evaluated vignette bootstrap/simulation sizes while retaining
  publication-grade settings in unevaluated examples. Source builds no
  longer include the audit article PDFs.
- Corrected the EIG reference to Starns, Cohen, and Rotello (2023).
- Corrected the lineup-memory simulator: the supplied lowest criterion
  now controls identification versus rejection, subsequent ordered
  criteria control confidence, and explicit criteria are preserved. The
  simulator now implements Independent Observations/MAX, Ensemble, and
  Integration exactly under its documented independent equal-variance
  assumptions. `"best_rest"` remains accepted for compatibility but is
  identified as a scale-equivalent parameterization of Ensemble.
- Reframed
  [`fit_max_sdt()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/fit_max_sdt.md)
  as a restricted, aggregate, single-criterion, equal-variance
  Independent-Observations fit estimated by minimum Pearson chi-squared.
  It is not a maximum-likelihood fit and is not the complete
  confidence-based Wixted et al. (2018) model.

### Major New Features (pyWitness-inspired)

al., 2024), significantly expanding r4lineups’ analytical capabilities
for eyewitness identification research.

### Statistical Audit (June 2026)

A component-by-component numerical audit of the statistical routines was
completed for this release. Fixes:

- **MAX SDT fitter**
  ([`fit_max_sdt()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/fit_max_sdt.md)):
  replaced the single boundary-prone optimizer start with a
  deterministic multistart grid plus Nelder-Mead polish; corrected the
  chi-square objective to use a proper outcome partition (correct-ID /
  filler-ID / reject); floored expected counts instead of dropping
  cells; corrected goodness-of-fit degrees of freedom (df = 3 x
  n_conditions - n_params); convergence is now reported honestly
- **Full ROC**: fixed `order = "apriori"` with `conf_bins` (labels were
  coerced to `NA`, silently breaking within-decision ordering)
- **PPV**: `ppv_by_confidence(correction = "effective")` computed the
  wrong effective size in the no-member-data fallback; now uses the
  pseudo-table counts directly
- **Calibration**: added a
  `confidence_scale = c("auto", "0-1", "0-100")` argument to
  [`make_calibration_data()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/make_calibration_data.md)
  and all callers; `auto` now warns when confidence looks like a
  Likert/0-10 scale instead of silently dividing by 100
- **Winter 2-HT**: removed the invalid single-condition goodness-of-fit
  chi-square test (the model is saturated, df = 0);
  [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) now reports a
  saturation note and the observed-vs-expected discrepancy as a
  convergence check
- **Diagnosticity ratio**: fixed diagnosticity-ratio bugs and documented
  the Haldane correction in
  [`ln_diag_ratio()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/ln_diag_ratio.md)
- Removed a duplicate internal
  [`entropy()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/entropy.md)
  definition that relied on file collation order

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed
  [`.extract_counts_from_df()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/dot-extract_counts_from_df.md)
  in `winter_2ht.R` to properly handle dataframe inputs
  - Issue: Names were being combined incorrectly (e.g.,
    “n_tp_suspect.suspect”)
  - Fix: Added [`unname()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/unname.html) to
    ensure clean names
  - Result: 2-HT model now works correctly with dataframe inputs
