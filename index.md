# r4lineups

Statistical tools for assessing lineup fairness, confidence‑accuracy
analyses, and face similarity in eyewitness identification research.

## Authorship and acknowledgements

Colin Tredoux and Tamsyn Naylor are the key authors of `r4lineups` and
were jointly responsible for the original package’s design and
development.

Development used multiple dynamically updated frontier models: Anthropic
Claude Sonnet 4 and 5 and Claude Opus 4.6 and 4.8, and OpenAI Codex with
GPT-5-family models including GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.6 Sol. Additional Claude
and Codex sessions were used, but exact session-level model identifiers
were not consistently recorded. These tools assisted with code review
and drafting, debugging, test scaffolding, documentation, package-check
remediation, and manuscript editing. Colin Tredoux and Tamsyn Naylor
reviewed, modified, and validated the AI-assisted outputs, made the
statistical and software-design decisions, and retain full
responsibility for accuracy, originality, licensing, and scholarly
claims.

This package implements computational approaches developed by many
researchers. We gratefully acknowledge their foundational work and cite
their publications in the documentation for the relevant functions and
vignettes. Any error in translating a published method into code is an
error in this package, not in the cited work. Please report suspected
errors through the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/CGTZA2/r4lineups/issues).

## What this package includes

  proportions, bootstrap CIs + distributions
- **Effective size**: E (Tredoux, 1998) and E (Malpass, 1981, adjusted)
- **Functional size & diagnosticity**: functional size, diagnosticity
  ratios, homogeneity tests
- **ROC / CAC / RAC**: confidence‑accuracy methods for lineup data
- **SDT summary comparisons**: d′/c/β from counts, variance estimates
  (Miller/Gourevitch/bootstrap), z‑tests
- **mSDT (multi‑item SDT)**: max filler distribution, parameter
  estimation from rejection rates, joint plots
- **Wixted lineup-memory models**: optional pyWitness-backed Independent
  Observations, Ensemble, and Integration fitting

## Installation

This repository is an R package. From R:

``` r

# from GitHub
remotes::install_github("CGTZA2/r4lineups")

# from local source
devtools::install()
```

If you prefer base R:

``` r
R CMD INSTALL .
```

### Optional Wixted model engine

The lineup-memory fitting interface uses a separately installed, pinned
pyWitness engine. Installation is explicit and isolated; it is never
triggered when r4lineups loads or during ordinary package checks.

``` r

install_pywitness()
check_pywitness_deps(initialize = TRUE)
```

## Core data format (confidence‑based analyses)

Functions like ROC/CAC/RAC/EIG/PPV expect a data frame with:

- `target_present` (logical or 0/1)
- `identification` (e.g., “suspect”, “filler”, “reject”)
- `confidence` (numeric)

See the built‑in example `lineup_example` and vignette tables for
concrete layouts.

## Quick starts

### Lineup bias and effective size

``` r

library(r4lineups)
data(nortje2012)

lineup_vec <- nortje2012$lineup_1
lineup_table <- table(lineup_vec)

# Target proportion (position 3)
lineup_prop_vec(lineup_vec, target_pos = 3, k = 6)

# Effective size (Tredoux)
esize_T(lineup_table)

# Bootstrap distributions
bias_dist <- lineup_bias_boot_dist(lineup_vec, target_pos = 3, k = 6, R = 1000)
plot_lineup_bias_distribution(bias_dist, target_pos = 3)

esize_dist <- esize_boot_dist(lineup_vec, k = 6, metric = "tredoux", R = 1000)
plot_esize_distribution(esize_dist, metric = "E (Tredoux, 1998)")
```

### ROC / CAC

``` r

data(lineup_example)
roc <- make_rocdata(lineup_example, lineup_size = 6)
cac <- make_cac(lineup_example, lineup_size = 6, confidence_bins = c(0, 60, 80, 100))
```

### Full ROC

``` r

fullroc <- make_fullroc(lineup_example, conf_bins = c(0, 60, 80, 100), lineup_size = 6)
plot_fullroc(fullroc)
```

### Competing lineup-memory models

Fit one fair simultaneous-lineup procedure or condition at a time. The
result contains R-native parameter, cell, fit, and engine tables and can
be saved without a live Python session.

``` r

fits <- fit_lineup_models(
  lineup_example,
  models = c("independent", "ensemble", "integration"),
  lineup_size = 6,
  confidence_bins = c(0, 60, 80, 100)
)
print(fits)
plot(fits, type = "fit")
```

pyWitness minimizes Pearson chi-squared. `loglik_at_estimate` is
diagnostic, not maximized; AIC and BIC are therefore not reported.
BEST-Rest and Ensemble are equivalent after criterion rescaling and must
not be ranked as independent models.

### Face similarity

``` r

install_r4lineups_python()
lineup <- lineup_similarity("target.jpg", c("foil1.jpg", "foil2.jpg"))
plot_lineup_similarity(lineup)
```

## Shiny app

The app bundles key analyses (bias, effective size, Bayesian inference,
ROC/CAC, EIG/PPV, face similarity). It is an interactive companion to
the package, not a complete replacement for the R API.

Package documentation is available at
<https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/>.

``` r

library(r4lineups)
run_r4lineups_app()
```

For deployment, the app lives at `inst/shiny/r4lineups_app`.

## Notes

- `notes/` contains working papers and test scripts and is **not** part
  of the package build.
- `pdfs/` contains local audit sources and is ignored by Git and package
  builds.
- For face similarity, Python dependencies are managed via
  [`install_r4lineups_python()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/install_r4lineups_python.md).
- For Wixted model fitting, pyWitness is managed separately via
  [`install_pywitness()`](https://cgtza2.github.io/r4lineups/reference/install_pywitness.md).
- Tests can be run with `testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat")`; package
  checks use standard `R CMD build` and `R CMD check` workflows.
