#' Effective Size (Tredoux, 1998)
#'
#' Function for generating Tredoux's transformed index-of-diversity
#' effective size.
#'
#' @param lineup_tab A table of lineup choices
#' @param unbiased Logical. If \code{FALSE} (the default) the plug-in estimator
#'   is returned, as in Tredoux (1998). If \code{TRUE}, the small-sample bias
#'   correction described below is applied. The default is unchanged so that
#'   existing analyses and published values are unaffected.
#' @details Tredoux (1998) proposed using Agresti and Agresti's (1978)
#'          index of diversity for lineup choices,
#'          \deqn{I = 1 - \frac{\sum_i o_i^2}{N^2},}
#'          where \eqn{o_i} is the observed count for lineup member \eqn{i}
#'          and \eqn{N} is the total number of choices. The index is then
#'          transformed back to an effective-size scale:
#'          \deqn{E' = \frac{1}{1-I} = \frac{N^2}{\sum_i o_i^2}
#'          = \frac{1}{\sum_i p_i^2}.}
#'          This formula is algebraically equivalent to a reciprocal
#'          concentration form.
#'
#' @section Small-sample bias:
#' The expression above is a \emph{plug-in} estimator: sample proportions are
#' substituted for the unknown \eqn{p_i}. Plug-in estimators of
#' \eqn{\sum_i p_i^2} are biased upward, so \eqn{E'} is biased
#' \strong{downward}. For \eqn{N} choices spread evenly over \eqn{k} members
#' the bias is approximately
#' \deqn{E[\hat{E}'] \approx \frac{Nk}{N + k - 1}, \qquad
#'       \mathrm{bias} = -\frac{k(k-1)}{N + k - 1}.}
#' A perfectly fair six-person lineup assessed with 50 choices therefore returns
#' about 5.47 rather than 6, and with 20 choices about 4.87. The bias is
#' negligible above a few hundred choices.
#'
#' With \code{unbiased = TRUE} the function substitutes the unbiased estimator
#' of \eqn{\sum_i p_i^2}, giving
#' \deqn{\hat{E}'_{\mathrm{corr}} = \frac{N(N-1)}{\sum_i o_i(o_i - 1)}.}
#' In simulation this removes essentially all of the bias, at a modest increase
#' in variance that disappears by \eqn{N \approx 100}.
#'
#' Which to use depends on what is being reported. For a description of the
#' choice distribution actually observed, the plug-in value is the quantity of
#' interest. For inference about the lineup that produced those choices — which
#' is the framing of Tredoux (1998) — the corrected form is the better estimator.
#' Note that the other functions in this family (\code{\link{esize_T_boot}},
#' \code{\link{esize_T_ci_n}}, \code{\link{i_esize_T}}) use the plug-in form.
