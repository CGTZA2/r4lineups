\title{List Available Face Detectors}
\usage{
available_detectors()
}
\value{
Character vector of detector names.
}
\description{
Returns a character vector of available face detection backends.
}
\details{
Available detectors (in rough order of accuracy/speed tradeoff):
\itemize{
  \item retinaface - Most accurate, recommended for research
  \item mtcnn - Good accuracy, moderate speed
  \item mediapipe - Fast, good for real-time
  \item opencv - Fastest, less accurate
  \item ssd - Fast CNN-based
  \item dlib - Classic HOG-based
  \item yolov8 - YOLO-based detection
  \item centerface - Anchor-free detection
  \item skip - Skip detection (use full image)
