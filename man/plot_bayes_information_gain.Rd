\title{Plot Information Gain Curves}
\usage{
plot_bayes_information_gain(bayes_obj, selected_responses = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bayes_obj}{List output from make_bayes_curves()}

\item{selected_responses}{Character vector of response categories to plot.
If NULL (default), plots all responses.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a plot showing how much uncertainty is reduced by different lineup responses.
}
\details{
Information gain curves show the reduction in uncertainty (measured in bits)
for each response type across different prior probabilities. Higher values
indicate more diagnostic responses. Information gain is maximized when the
prior is near 0.5 (maximum uncertainty).
