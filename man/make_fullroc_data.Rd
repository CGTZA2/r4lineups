\title{Compute Full ROC Data for Lineup Identification (Smith & Yang, 2020)}
\usage{
make_fullroc_data(
  data,
  conf_bins = NULL,
  order = c("diagnosticity", "apriori"),
  lineup_size = 6,
  epsilon = 0.001
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item target_present: Logical. TRUE if guilty suspect in lineup, FALSE if innocent
  \item identification: Character. "suspect", "filler", or "reject"
  \item confidence: Numeric. Confidence rating (higher = more confident)
}}

\item{conf_bins}{Numeric vector specifying confidence bin boundaries (default = NULL,
which uses unique confidence values). Can specify bins like c(0, 60, 80, 100) to
create low (0-60), medium (60-80), and high (80-100) confidence categories.}

\item{order}{Character. Method for ordering response categories:
\itemize{
  \item "diagnosticity": Order by diagnosticity ratio (DR = HR/FAR) (default)
  \item "apriori": Use a-priori ordering (suspect high conf → filler/reject low conf)
}}

\item{lineup_size}{Integer. Number of people in the lineup (default = 6)}

\item{epsilon}{Numeric. Small value to add when FAR = 0 to avoid infinite DR (default = 0.001)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item roc_data: Dataframe with cumulative hit rates and false alarm rates
    \item auc: Full area under the curve
    \item order_used: The ordering method used
    \item diagnosticity_table: Table showing non-cumulative rates and DR for each category
    \item n_target_present: Number of target-present lineups
    \item n_target_absent: Number of target-absent lineups
  }
}
\description{
Computes full Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) data using ALL response
categories (suspect ID, filler ID, rejection) following Smith & Yang (2020).
This method distinguishes between investigator discriminability and eyewitness
discriminability.
}
\details{
This function implements the "full ROC" method described in Smith & Yang (2020).
Unlike traditional partial ROC curves that only use suspect identifications,
this method uses ALL eyewitness responses:
\itemize{
  \item Suspect identifications (evidence of guilt)
  \item Filler identifications (evidence of innocence)
  \item Lineup rejections (evidence of innocence)
}

Each response type is crossed with confidence levels to create decision criteria.
These are ordered by their diagnosticity ratio (HR/FAR) or by a-priori ordering,
then cumulative hit and false alarm rates are computed to form the full ROC curve.

The full ROC provides a threshold-free measure of investigator discriminability—
the ability to distinguish guilty from innocent suspects using ALL available
eyewitness evidence.

\dontrun{
# Example data structure:
lineup_data <- data.frame(
  target_present = c(rep(TRUE, 50), rep(FALSE, 50)),
  identification = sample(c("suspect", "filler", "reject"), 100, replace = TRUE),
  confidence = sample(c(20, 40, 60, 80, 100), 100, replace = TRUE)
)

# Compute full ROC with diagnosticity ordering
fullroc_result <- make_fullroc_data(lineup_data)
print(fullroc_result$auc)

# Compute full ROC with specified confidence bins
fullroc_binned <- make_fullroc_data(lineup_data, conf_bins = c(0, 60, 80, 100))
}
