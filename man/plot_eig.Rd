\title{Plot Information Gain by Response Category}
\usage{
plot_eig(eig_obj, max_responses = 15, color_by = "identification")
}
\arguments{
\item{eig_obj}{A lineup_eig object from compute_eig()}

\item{max_responses}{Maximum number of response categories to display (default = 15).
Categories are sorted by information gain (highest first).}

\item{color_by}{Character. Color bars by "identification" decision or "ig" (information gain).
Default = "identification".}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a ggplot2 visualization showing information gain for each response
category in an EIG analysis.
}
\details{
This function creates a bar plot showing information gain for each response
category. Response categories are ordered by IG (descending), with the most
informative responses shown first. Colors distinguish different identification
decisions (suspect/filler/reject).
