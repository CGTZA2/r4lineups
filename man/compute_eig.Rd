\title{Compute Expected Information Gain (EIG)}
\usage{
compute_eig(eig_data, prior_guilt = 0.5, confidence_bins = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{eig_data}{List output from make_eig_data(), or a dataframe with columns:
target_present, identification, confidence}

\item{prior_guilt}{Numeric. Prior probability that suspect is guilty (default = 0.5)}

\item{confidence_bins}{Numeric vector of bin edges (only used if eig_data is a dataframe)}
}
\value{
A list of class "lineup_eig" containing:
  \itemize{
    \item eig: Expected Information Gain in bits
    \item response_data: Dataframe with information gain for each response category
    \item prior_guilt: Prior probability used
    \item prior_entropy: Entropy of prior (baseline uncertainty)
    \item n_guilty: Number of target-present lineups
    \item n_innocent: Number of target-absent lineups
  }
}
\description{
Computes Expected Information Gain for lineup identification procedures
following Starns et al. (2023). EIG quantifies the evidentiary value of
witness responses using information theory.
}
\details{
EIG measures how much information (in bits) a witness response provides about
guilt vs. innocence. It is computed as:

\deqn{EIG = \sum_x p(x) \times [H(prior) - H(p(guilty|x))]}

where:
\itemize{
  \item x = response category (e.g., "suspect_high_confidence")
  \item p(x) = probability of that response
  \item H() = Shannon entropy
  \item p(guilty|x) = posterior probability of guilt given response x
}

Higher EIG values indicate more diagnostic procedures. EIG = 0 means no
information gain (responses don't distinguish guilty from innocent).
EIG = 1 means perfect information (complete resolution of uncertainty).
