\title{Compute CAC (Confidence-Accuracy Characteristic) Data}
\usage{
make_cacdata(data, lineup_size = 6, confidence_bins = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item target_present: Logical. TRUE if guilty suspect in lineup
  \item identification: Character. "suspect", "filler", or "reject"
  \item confidence: Numeric. Confidence rating
}}

\item{lineup_size}{Integer. Number of people in lineup (default = 6)}

\item{confidence_bins}{Numeric vector of bin edges for grouping confidence
(e.g., c(0, 60, 80, 100) creates bins 0-60, 61-80, 81-100).
If NULL, uses individual confidence levels.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item cac_data: Dataframe with confidence levels and accuracy
    \item n_ids_per_level: Number of suspect IDs at each confidence level
    \item overall_accuracy: Overall accuracy across all suspect IDs
  }
}
\description{
Computes confidence-accuracy data for lineup identifications following
Mickes (2015). CAC analysis shows the relationship between confidence
and accuracy for suspect identifications.
}
\details{
CAC analysis computes, for each confidence level:
\deqn{Accuracy = \frac{Correct Suspect IDs}{Correct Suspect IDs + Incorrect Suspect IDs}}

Only suspect IDs are included (filler IDs are ignored). For target-absent
lineups with no designated innocent suspect, filler IDs are divided by
lineup size to estimate incorrect suspect IDs.

According to Mickes (2015), CAC analysis is most relevant for triers of fact
(judges/jurors) evaluating estimator variables (e.g., exposure duration,
retention interval). It shows how trustworthy an ID is at different confidence
levels.
