\title{Compute ROC Data for Lineup Identification}
\usage{
make_rocdata(data, lineup_size = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item target_present: Logical. TRUE if guilty suspect in lineup, FALSE if innocent
  \item identification: Character. "suspect", "filler", or "reject"
  \item confidence: Numeric. Confidence rating (higher = more confident)
}}

\item{lineup_size}{Integer. Number of people in the lineup (default = 6).
Used to estimate false ID rate when fillers are chosen from target-absent lineups.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item roc_data: Dataframe with correct_id_rate, false_id_rate, and confidence
    \item pauc: Partial area under the curve
    \item n_target_present: Number of target-present lineups
    \item n_target_absent: Number of target-absent lineups
  }
}
\description{
Computes Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) data from lineup identification
experiments following the methodology of Mickes, Wixted, and Gronlund.
}
\details{
This function computes ROC curves following Wixted & Mickes (2012) and
Mickes (2015). For each confidence level:
\itemize{
  \item Correct ID rate = proportion of target-present lineups where suspect identified
  \item False ID rate = proportion of target-absent lineups where suspect identified
}

When no innocent suspect is designated in target-absent lineups, filler IDs
are divided by lineup size to estimate the false ID rate.
