\title{Plot BREE Curve}
\usage{
plot_bree(bree_obj, show_reference = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bree_obj}{List output from make_bree_curve()}

\item{show_reference}{Logical. Whether to show reference line at delta = 0.
Default = TRUE.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a plot showing the base-rate shift required for one procedure to
match another's diagnostic value.
}
\details{
The BREE curve shows how much the base rate (prior probability) would need
to shift for Procedure B to yield the same posterior as Procedure A.

Positive delta: Procedure A is more diagnostic (B needs higher base rate to match)
Negative delta: Procedure B is more diagnostic (B needs lower base rate to match)
Zero delta: Procedures are equally diagnostic
