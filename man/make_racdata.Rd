\title{Compute RAC (Response Time-Accuracy Characteristic) Data}
\usage{
make_racdata(data, lineup_size = 6, time_bins = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item target_present: Logical. TRUE if guilty suspect in lineup
  \item identification: Character. "suspect", "filler", or "reject"
  \item response_time: Numeric. Response time in milliseconds (or seconds)
}}

\item{lineup_size}{Integer. Number of people in lineup (default = 6)}

\item{time_bins}{Numeric vector of bin edges for grouping response times
(e.g., c(0, 5000, 10000, 15000, 20000) creates bins in milliseconds).
If NULL, uses individual response time values (not recommended for
continuous data).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item rac_data: Dataframe with response time bins and accuracy
    \item n_ids_per_bin: Number of suspect IDs in each time bin
    \item overall_accuracy: Overall accuracy across all suspect IDs
  }
}
\description{
Computes response time-accuracy data for lineup identifications following
the approach described in Seale-Carlisle et al. (2019) and implemented in
pyWitness (Mickes et al., 2024). RAC analysis shows the relationship between
response time and accuracy for suspect identifications.
}
\details{
RAC analysis computes, for each response time bin:
\deqn{Accuracy = \frac{Correct Suspect IDs}{Correct Suspect IDs + Incorrect Suspect IDs}}

Only suspect IDs are included (filler IDs and rejections are ignored).
For target-absent lineups with no designated innocent suspect, filler IDs
are divided by lineup size to estimate incorrect suspect IDs.

RAC analysis is useful for examining the speed-accuracy tradeoff in
eyewitness identifications. Faster responses typically indicate stronger
memory, and RAC curves often show higher accuracy for faster response times.
