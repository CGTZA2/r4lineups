\usage{
make_bree_curve(
  data_proc_a,
  data_proc_b,
  reference_response = "suspect",
  confidence_bins = NULL,
  prior_grid = seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_proc_a}{A dataframe for procedure A with columns: target_present,
identification, confidence (standard lineup data format)}

\item{data_proc_b}{A dataframe for procedure B (same format as proc_a)}

\item{reference_response}{Character string specifying which response to compare
(e.g., "suspect" for suspect IDs). Default = "suspect".}

\item{confidence_bins}{Optional numeric vector of bin edges if using confidence-based
response (e.g., c(0, 60, 80, 100)). If provided, reference_response should
specify both identification and bin (e.g., "suspect_(80,100]")}

\item{prior_grid}{Numeric vector of prior probabilities for procedure A
(default: seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01))}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item bree_curve: Dataframe with prior_a, posterior_a, prior_b, and delta
    \item proc_a_likelihoods: Likelihoods for procedure A
    \item proc_b_likelihoods: Likelihoods for procedure B
    \item reference_response: The response category used for comparison
  }
}
\description{
Computes BREE curves showing the base-rate shift required for one procedure
to produce the same posterior probability as another procedure, following
Wells, Yang, & Smalarz (2015).
}
\details{
BREE curves answer the question: "How much would the base rate need to change
for Procedure B to yield the same posterior probability as Procedure A?"

For each prior probability in procedure A:
1. Compute the posterior p(guilty|x) for the reference response in procedure A
2. Find the prior probability in procedure B that yields the same posterior
3. Delta = prior_B - prior_A

Interpretation:
\itemize{
  \item Delta > 0: Procedure B requires a higher base rate to match A's posterior
    (A is more diagnostic)
  \item Delta < 0: Procedure B requires a lower base rate (B is more diagnostic)
  \item Delta = 0: Procedures are equally diagnostic
